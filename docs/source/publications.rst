O.; Klessen, Ralf S. [`MNRAS, 470(4), 4453-4472 (2017) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.470.4453R/abstract>`_].. figure:: ../figs/warpfield1.png        What type of feedback dominates? - a comparison of relative forces between low (top panel) and high (bottom panel) cloud mass and star formation efficiency (Figure 5).Star clusters interact with the interstellar medium (ISM) in various ways, most importantly in the destruction of molecular star-forming clouds, resulting in inefficient star formation on galactic scales. On cloud scales, ionizing radiation creates HII regions, while stellar winds and supernovae (SNe) drive the ISM into thin shells. These shells are accelerated by the combined effect of winds, radiation pressure, and SN explosions, and slowed down by gravity. Since radiative and mechanical feedback is highly interconnected, they must be taken into account in a self-consistent and combined manner, including the coupling of radiation and matter. We present a new semi-analytic 1D feedback model for isolated massive clouds (:math:`\geq 10^5 M_\odot`) to calculate shell dynamics and shell structure simultaneously. It allows us to scan a large range of physical parameters (gas density, star formation efficiency, and metallicity) and to estimate escape fractions of ionizing radiation :math:`f_{\rm esc, i}`, the minimum star formation efficiency :math:`\epsilon_{\rm ff}` required to drive an outflow, and recollapse time-scales for clouds that are not destroyed by feedback. Our results show that there is no simple answer to the question of what dominates cloud dynamics, and that each feedback process significantly influences the efficiency of the others. We find that variations in natal cloud density can very easily explain differences between dense-bound and diffuse-open star clusters. We also predict, as a consequence of feedback, a 4-6 Myr age difference for massive clusters with multiple generations. WARPFIELD 2.0: feedback-regulated minimum star formation efficiencies of giant molecular clouds -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rahner, Daniel; Pellegrini, Eric W.; Glover, Simon C. O.; Klessen, Ralf S. [`MNRAS, 483(2), 2547-2560 (2019) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.483.2547R/abstract>`_].. figure:: ../figs/warpfield2.jpeg        A schematic view of cloud/cluster model used in WARPFIELD (Figure 1).        Star formation is an inefficient process and in general only a small fraction of the gas in a giant molecular cloud (GMC) is turned into stars. This is partly due to the negative effect of stellar feedback from young massive star clusters. Recently, we introduced a novel 1D numerical treatment of the effects of stellar feedback from young massive clusters on their natal clouds, which we named WARPFIELD. Here, we present version 2 of the WARPFIELD code, containing improved treatments of the thermal evolution of the gas and the fragmentation of the feedback-driven shell. As part of this update, we have produced new cooling and heating tables that account for the combined effects of photoionization and collisional ionization on the cooling rate, which we now make publicly available. We employ our updated version of WARPFIELD to investigate the impact of stellar feedback on GMCs with a broad range of masses and surface densities and a variety of density profiles. We show that the minimum star formation efficiency (SFE) :math:`\epsilon_{\rm min}`, i.e., the SFE above which the cloud is destroyed by feedback, is mainly set by the average cloud surface density. An SFE of 1-6 per cent is generally sufficient to destroy a GMC. We also find an SFE per free-fall time :math:`\epsilon_{\rm ff}` ~ 0.3 per cent, in good agreement with recent observations. Our results imply that feedback alone is sufficient to explain the low observed SFE of GMCs. Finally, we show that very massive clouds with steep density profiles - possible proxies of the giant clumps observed in galaxies at :math:`z \approx 2` - are more resilient to feedback than typical GMCs, with :math:`\epsilon_{\rm min}` between 1 and 12 per cent.     WARPFIELD-EMP: The self-consistent prediction of emission lines from evolving HII regions in dense molecular clouds -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pellegrini, E. W.; Rahner, D.; Reissl, S.; Glover, S. C. O.; Klessen, R. S.; Rousseau-Nepton, L.; Herrera-Camus, R. [`MNRAS, 496(1), 339-363 (2020) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496..339P/abstract>`_] .. figure:: ../figs/warpfieldemp.png        An example of a comparison between our model (WARPFIELD-EMP) and real observational data (SITELLE) in NGC 628 (Figure 7).We present the warpfield emission predictor, WARPFIELD-EMP, which couples the 1D stellar feedback code WARPFIELD with the CLOUDY HII region/PDR code and the POLARIS radiative transfer code,in order to make detailed predictions for the time-dependent line and continuum emission arising from the HII region and PDR surrounding an evolving star cluster. WARPFIELD-EMP accounts for a wide range of physical processes (photoionization, stellar winds, supernovae, radiation pressure, gravity, thermal conduction, radiative cooling, dust extinction etc.) and yet runs quickly enough to allow us to explore broad ranges of different model parameters. We compare the results of an extensive set of models with SITELLE observations of a large sample of HII regions in NGC 628 and find very good agreement, particularly for the highest signal-to-noise observations. We show that our approach of modelling individual clouds from first principles (instead of in terms of dimensionless quantities such as the ionization parameter) allows us to avoid long-standing degeneracies in the interpretation of HII region diagnostics and enables us to relate these diagnostics to important physical parameterssuch as cloud mass or cluster age. Finally, we explore the implications of our modelsregarding the reliability of simple metallicity diagnostics, the properties of long-lived embedded clusters, and the role played by winds and supernovae in regulating HII region and PDR line emission.WARPFIELD population synthesis: the physics of (extra-)Galactic star formation and feedback-driven cloud structure and emission from sub-to-kpc scales ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pellegrini, Eric W.; Reissl, Stefan; Rahner, Daniel; Klessen, Ralf S.; Glover, Simon C.

[`MNRAS, 498(3), 3193-3214 (2020) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498.3193P/abstract>`_].. figure:: ../figs/warpfieldpop.png        A synthetic all-sky H\ :math:`\alpha` emission map as seen by an observer at the position of Earth in a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy (Figure 12).    We present a novel method to model galactic-scale star formation and emission of star clusters and a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM). We combine global parameters, including star formation rate and metallicity, with the 1D cloud evolution code WARPFIELD to model the sources of feedback within a star-forming galaxy. Within individual star-forming regions, we include stellar evolution, stellar winds, radiation pressure, and supernovae, all coupled to the dynamical evolution of the 1D parental cloud in a highly non-linear fashion. Heating of the diffuse galactic gas and dust is calculated self-consistently with the age-, mass-, and density-dependent escape fractions of photons from these fully resolved local star-forming regions. We construct the interstellar radiation field, and we employ the multifrequency radiative transfer code POLARIS to produce synthetic emission maps for a one-to-one comparison with observations. We apply this to a cosmological simulation of a Milky-Way-like galaxy built-up in a high-resolution MHD simulation of cosmic structure formation. From this, we produce the multiscale/phase distribution of ISM density and temperature and present a synthesized all-sky H\ :math:`\alpha` map. We use a multipole expansion to show that the resulting maps reproduce all observed statistical emission characteristics.Next, we predict [S III] 9530 Å, a key emission line that will be observed in several large forthcoming surveys. It suffers less extinction than other lines and provides information about star formation in very dense environments that are otherwise observationally inaccessible optically. Finally, we explore the effects of differential extinction, and discuss the consequences for the interpretation of H\ :math:`\alpha` emission at different viewing angles by an extragalactic observer.
