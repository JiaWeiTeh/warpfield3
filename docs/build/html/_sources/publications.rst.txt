O.; Klessen, Ralf S. [`MNRAS, 470(4), 4453-4472 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.470.4453R/abstract>`_]Star clusters interact with the interstellar medium (ISM) in various ways, most importantly in the destruction of molecular star-forming clouds, resulting in inefficient star formation on galactic scales. On cloud scales, ionizing radiation creates HII regions, while stellar winds and supernovae (SNe) drive the ISM into thin shells. These shells are accelerated by the combined effect of winds, radiation pressure, and SN explosions, and slowed down by gravity. Since radiative and mechanical feedback is highly interconnected, they must be taken into account in a self-consistent and combined manner, including the coupling of radiation and matter. We present a new semi-analytic 1D feedback model for isolated massive clouds (≥105 M⊙) to calculate shell dynamics and shell structure simultaneously. It allows us to scan a large range of physical parameters (gas density, star formation efficiency, and metallicity) and to estimate escape fractions of ionizing radiation fesc, I, the minimum star formation efficiency ɛmin required to drive an outflow, and recollapse time-scales for clouds that are not destroyed by feedback. Our results show that there is no simple answer to the question of what dominates cloud dynamics, and that each feedback process significantly influences the efficiency of the others. We find that variations in natal cloud density can very easily explain differences between dense-bound and diffuse-open star clusters. We also predict, as a consequence of feedback, a 4-6 Myr age difference for massive clusters with multiple generations. WARPFIELD 2.0: feedback-regulated minimum star formation efficiencies of giant molecular clouds -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rahner, Daniel; Pellegrini, Eric W.; Glover, Simon C. O.; Klessen, Ralf S. [`MNRAS, 483(2), 2547-2560 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.483.2547R/abstract>`_]Star formation is an inefficient process and in general only a small fraction of the gas in a giant molecular cloud (GMC) is turned into stars. This is partly due to the negative effect of stellar feedback from young massive star clusters. Recently, we introduced a novel 1D numerical treatment of the effects of stellar feedback from young massive clusters on their natal clouds, which we named WARPFIELD. Here, we present version 2 of the WARPFIELD code, containing improved treatments of the thermal evolution of the gas and the fragmentation of the feedback-driven shell. As part of this update, we have produced new cooling and heating tables that account for the combined effects of photoionization and collisional ionization on the cooling rate, which we now make publicly available. We employ our updated version of WARPFIELD to investigate the impact of stellar feedback on GMCs with a broad range of masses and surface densities and a variety of density profiles. We show that the minimum star formation efficiency (SFE) ɛmin, i.e. the SFE above which the cloud is destroyed by feedback, is mainly set by the average cloud surface density. An SFE of 1-6 per cent is generally sufficient to destroy a GMC. We also find an SFE per free-fall time ɛff ∼ 0.3 per cent, in good agreement with recent observations. Our results imply that feedback alone is sufficient to explain the low observed SFE of GMCs. Finally, we show that very massive clouds with steep density profiles - possible proxies of the giant clumps observed in galaxies at z ≈ 2 - are more resilient to feedback than typical GMCs, with ɛmin between 1 and 12 per cent.     WARPFIELD-EMP: The self-consistent prediction of emission lines from evolving HII regions in dense molecular clouds -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pellegrini, E. W.; Rahner, D.; Reissl, S.; Glover, S. C. O.; Klessen, R. S.; Rousseau-Nepton, L.; Herrera-Camus, R. [`MNRAS, 496(1), 339-363 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496..339P/abstract>`_] We present the warpfield emission predictor, WARPFIELD-EMP, which couples the 1D stellar feedback code warpfield with the cloudy HII region/PDR code and the POLARIS radiative transfer code, in order to make detailed predictions for the time-dependent line and continuum emission arising from the HII region and PDR surrounding an evolving star cluster. WARPFIELD-EMP accounts for a wide range of physical processes (photoionization, stellar winds, supernovae, radiation pressure, gravity, thermal conduction, radiative cooling, dust extinction etc.) and yet runs quickly enough to allow us to explore broad ranges of different model parameters. We compare the results of an extensive set of models with SITELLE observations of a large sample of HII regions in NGC 628 and find very good agreement, particularly for the highest signal-to-noise observations. We show that our approach of modelling individual clouds from first principles (instead of in terms of dimensionless quantities such as the ionization parameter) allows us to avoid long-standing degeneracies in the interpretation of HII region diagnostics and enables us to relate these diagnostics to important physical parameters such as cloud mass or cluster age. Finally, we explore the implications of our models regarding the reliability of simple metallicity diagnostics, the properties of long-lived embedded clusters, and the role played by winds and supernovae in regulating HII region and PDR line emission... figure:: ../figs/warpfieldemp.png        Comparison between model and observation of regions in NGC 628.
