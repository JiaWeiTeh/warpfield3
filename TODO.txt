"""This script records things to add/do/ASK"""> examplt.param: add ability to randomize input, such that user is able to addthe limits of randomizer (e.g., randomize between 1e4 and 1e9). Additionally,add the ability to randomize ONLY parameters that are not specified. The minimummass for SLUG is 20M i think.> What is the input required for GASSPY to work? Output that.> The ability to input arbritrary imf power laws> Run simulation without r_restart and t_intercloud and small_dt_save and cs_bubble and ncluster_check and rdotdot0> Add ability to select which output columns user requires to savememory. E.g., if user specifies only R and LBol, do not outputdata for tSN, Lw, etc etc.> Difference between cf_end, cfmin, and minimum 50% when immediate_leak = False?Which one determines the change of phase? Also, why is n_new = n/cf instead ofn_new = n * cf> Change the output format from     output/metallicity/mCloud/BE_param_coredense/sfe/..to      output/model_name_summary.txt + output/model_name_prop(1, 2, 3...).fits    > Remember to update read_param.py file if new parameters are added.> make sure that there is no mixing between rho (g/cm3) and n (1/cm3)> In a future iteration of our method, we plan to self-consistently calculate sigma0 from the time-variable stellar spectrum.> Make all calculations in cgs if possible. This is because in WARPFIELD some codes work in astronomical units (e.g., pc, Msun).> make sure all "params" are given descriptiion, such as warpfield_params, bubble_params etc.> Make output depend on verbosity> [removed] to find removed but possibly important stuffs> old code: to find the name of old code> Make sure all outputs are in one directory> Add function to immediately calculate and append density_specific_param and sigma_dust into the param class.> Final: delete all print debugs> remember that most cloudy and write_cloudy related files are set to False and are commented out. We need to make sure it will work and all related variablesand code lines are included if user decides to include write_cloudy = True.> In addition, we are always assuming sb99 = True, meaning we will always use SB99output files. In the future we should probably also add options for manual inputs.> Possibility to use input() for user input metallicity and mass. > check different path inputs for cooling, params etc to see if it works other than default. > In moritz's version, nCore = 1e3. But usually (in thesis/paper), these are 1e5-1e6. Are we using the right values?> Add parameter :     # guess for dMdt_factor (classical Weaver is 1.646; this is given as the     # constant 'A' in Eq 33, Weaver+77)    > Use files to track R1R2 and R2pR2 like the previous code.         >     # TODO: For very strong winds (clusters above 1e7 Msol), this number heeds to be higher!=============================== DONE ===============================> Can we use a fixed value for temperature of BOnnor Ebert spheres? I.e., T = 10^4K?    - No> The ability to use argparse to call param files.    - Done> what is the difference between dens_cloud and n_cloud?    - one is mass density and one is number density (?)> Is nedge and nend the same thing? (in AutoT)    - they are; both are being compared to solve for T.> make everything BE related cgs and not in SI units.    - Unfortunately this is inevitable and the equation is written such that    SI units must be used.            =============================== WRONG ===============================> For alpha = 0    - original: nEdge is nCore    - should be: nEdge is nAvg    > in Weaver equation 7 for calculation of bubble temperature: isn't it 2.07e6? Why 1.51 instead in InitPhaseParam for T0?        > Why is spitzer constant C 1.2e-6 in Weaver, but 0.6e-7 in Daniel's paper? Why the factor of 2?    > A**5/2? Why is there no exponential in dMdt?
