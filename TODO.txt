"""This script records things to add/do/ASK"""> examplt.param: add ability to randomize input, such that user is able to addthe limits of randomizer (e.g., randomize between 1e4 and 1e9). Additionally,add the ability to randomize ONLY parameters that are not specified. The minimummass for SLUG is 20M i think.> What is the input required for GASSPY to work? Output that.> The ability to input arbritrary imf power laws> Run simulation without r_restart and t_intercloud and small_dt_save and cs_bubble and ncluster_check and rdotdot0> Add ability to select which output columns user requires to savememory. E.g., if user specifies only R and LBol, do not outputdata for tSN, Lw, etc etc.> Difference between cf_end, cfmin, and minimum 50% when immediate_leak = False?Which one determines the change of phase? Also, why is n_new = n/cf instead ofn_new = n * cf> Change the output format from     output/metallicity/mCloud/BE_param_coredense/sfe/..to      output/model_name_summary.txt + output/model_name_prop(1, 2, 3...).fits    > Remember to update read_param.py file if new parameters are added.> make sure that there is no mixing between rho (g/cm3) and n (1/cm3)> make everything BE related cgs and not in SI units.> Can we use a fixed value for temperature of BOnnor Ebert spheres? I.e., T = 10^4K?> Is nedge and nend the same thing? (in AutoT)> Check units in equation, whether they are in cgs, SI, or astronomy units (e.g., Msol, pc)=============================== DONE ===============================> The ability to use argparse to call param files.> what is the difference between dens_cloud and n_cloud?
